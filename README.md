### Week 3, 4 & 5: Development â€“ Backend & Frontend Implementation

### Initial migrations and superuser setup
- The developer ran "python manage.py migrate" to apply Djangoâ€™s default migrations (for users, sessions, admin, etc.).
- Then, I created a superuser using "createsuperuser" to get access to the Django Admin Panel.
![SUPER USER INTERFACE](assets/SUPERUSERINTERFACER.png)

### Routes connection and test endpoint
- A new "core/urls.py" file was created to define the appâ€™s internal routes.
- It was linked to the main router in "barber_backend/urls.py" using "path('api/', include('core.urls'))".
- A test route "/api/ping/" was implemented and returned a simple JSON: "{"message": "pong"}".

### User registration ("/api/register/")
- A public endpoint "POST /api/register/" was created to allow new user registration.
- The view used "User.objects.create_user()" to create users with a username, email, and password.
- CSRF checks were disabled using "@csrf_exempt" since it's consumed via Postman or external clients.
![API REGISTER](assets/APIendpointPOSTMANregisterpost.png)
### JWT authentication ("/api/login/")
- The developer installed "djangorestframework" and "djangorestframework-simplejwt".
- JWT support was added to "settings.py" under "REST_FRAMEWORK" settings.
- The login endpoint "POST /api/login/" was added using "TokenObtainPairView", returning "access" and "refresh" tokens.
![API LOGIN](assets/loginPOSTMANAPIendpoint.png)
### Authenticated user profile ("/api/profile/")
- A protected route "GET /api/profile/" was added using "@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])".
- It returns the authenticated userâ€™s "username", "email", and "id".
- Requires sending the JWT "access" token in the "Authorization" header.
![API GET PROFLE](assets/apiENDPOINTGETpostman.png)

### Appointments model and creation ("/api/appointments/")
- The models "Service", "Barber", and "Appointment" were defined in "models.py".
- Migrations were generated and applied to create the related tables.
- These models were registered in the admin to be created easily through the dashboard.
- A serializer was created for the "Appointment" model.
- A secure endpoint "POST /api/appointments/" was implemented to allow users to book a service by sending "service", "barber", "date", and "time". The "user" field is automatically set using the JWT token.
![API APPOIMENTS](assets/postAPPOIMENT.png)
## GET /api/my-appointments/
- View protected with "IsAuthenticated"
- Returns appointments ("Appointment") only for the authenticated user
- Serializer: "AppointmentSerializer"
- Tested with JWT in Postman
![API GET APPOIMENT](assets/GETAPPOIMENTS.png)
## POST /api/checkout/
- Integrated Stripe Checkout in test mode
- Creates a payment session for an existing "Appointment"
- Returns a "checkout_url" to the frontend
- Redirection corrected by adding "/api/success/" and "/api/cancel/" routes
- Successfully tested via Postman and browser
![API POST PAYMENT](assets/POSTpayment.png)
## GET /api/payments/
- Created the "Payment" model with fields: "user", "appointment", "amount", "payment_date"
- Created "PaymentSerializer"
- Protected view listing payments for the authenticated user
- Initially tested by manually creating a "Payment" via the admin
